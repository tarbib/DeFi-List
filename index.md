## Welcome to the DeFi List

You are able to sort and filter the following cards:

The list is not exhaustive and should be updated continuously. I categorized all the services in these categories :

- Data aggregation
- Aggregated DEX: helps you to get the best trades while aggretating information from different DEX (Decentralized Exchanges)
- Dashboard: gives you an overview of your assets
- DEX: Decentralized Exchanges
- Off-ramp: Let you go from crypto to fiat.
- On-ramp: fiat to crypto.
- Prices aggregator
- Wallet: Ethereum Wallet
- Earn: Let you earn some interest or fees
- Dev tools: services for developpers to build dApps
- Insurance: Decentralized insurance for your investments.
- No code: building dApps without coding skills
- Learn: ressources on DeFi
- Pooling: making money by providing liquidity.

I have been following (and enjoying!) the DeFi space for a little while now and accumulated many websites in my bookmarks folder. While being locked-down during few weeks, I decided to rearrange it and thought : "Would not it be useful to others?". With limited coding skills I gave a try to Github Pages and Airtable and the result is what you are hopefully seeing right now (If you use extensions to block trackers you may need to allow airtable).

_If you have any remarks: feel free to open an issue on Github._
